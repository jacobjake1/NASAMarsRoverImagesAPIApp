# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Jacob**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**NASA Mars Rover Images API** is an android app that **retrives images from NASA's rovers on mars.*

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **😀😃😄**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you added to improve the app!
- [x] I added hundrends of images you can scroll through, would be the entire gallery they have, but reaches API limit request

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **NASA**.
